The code in the autodiff sub-directory provides methods for automatic differentiation (AD) of arbitrary functions implemented in C++, either as lambda functions or functors.  AD consists of a set of techniques to evaluate the derivative of a function implemented as a computer program. AD  does not provide a symbolic form of the derivatives, and AD is not a numerical approximation technique. Instead, the derivatives obtained by AD are exact and exploit the fact that every function implemented on a computer can be represented by a sequence of arithmetic operations and basic functions, i.e., addition, multiplication, and sin, cos, log, etc. The derivatives in AD with respect to the input arguments are obtained by applying the chain rule on the recorded sequence of operations. For more theoretical details, the users are referred to [1].


AD can be implemented on a compiler level by source code transformations or by using some of the features of modern object-oriented languages like operator overloading and templating. Even though several AD implementations on a compiler level exist, they are often utilized for simple functions written in languages like Fortran and C, and developments for general C++ applications are still in their infancy.  The MFEM implementation relies on native and external C++ libraries like CoDiPack [2].  The users can choose the AD engine during the configuration phase. It should be pointed out that the choice does not affect the actual utilization of AD  in the code. It can impact only the performance and memory utilization. 


Two distinguished modes, forward and reverse, can be easily identified in software implementations of automatic differentiation.  For a function $f(\mathbf{x}):\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow\mathbb{R}^m$, forward mode implementations evaluate

$$

       \dot{\mathbf{y}}&=f'\left(\mathbf{x}\right)\dot{\mathbf{x}}, \quad \dot{\mathbf{x}}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times 1}, \dot{\mathbf{y}}\in\mathbb{R}^{

m\times1},$$

where the vector $\dot{\mathbf{x}}$ is specified by the user. Therefore, to extract the Jacobian $f'\left(\mathbf{x}\right)\dot{\mathbf{x}}$ one has to call the AD procedure $n$ times with n different vectors $\dot{\mathbf{x}}$. 


# Dual numbers


In forward mode, the derivative information propagates from the input arguments to the output results. In MFEM, this is achieved with the help of the so-called dual number arithmetics. The native low-level implementation can be found in the header file fdual.hpp.  The file implements a large number of basic functions, and if necessary additional basic and more complex functions can be easily added by following the examples in the file. 


A dual number  $x+\varepsilon x'$ consists of a primal/real part and a dual part dragging the derivative information. Every real number can be represented as $x+\varepsilon 0 $. The arithmetic is defined with the help of dummy symbol $\varepsilon$ by specifying that $\varepsilon^2=0$. Based on the above, the following set of differentiation rules can be easily derived.


\begin{itemize}
\item{$\left(x+\varepsilon x'\right)+\left(y+\varepsilon y'\right)=\left(x+y\right)+\varepsilon\left(x'+y'\right)$} 
\item{$\left(x+\varepsilon x'\right)*\left(y+\varepsilon y'\right)=xy+\varepsilon\left(yx'+xy'\right)$} 
\item{$f\left(x+\varepsilon x'\right)=f\left(x\right)+\varepsilon f'\left(x\right)x'$} 
\item{$f\left(g \left(x+\varepsilon x'\right) \right)= f\left(g \left(x\right)+\varepsilon g'\left(x\right) x'\right) = f\left(g \left(x \right)\right)+\varepsilon f'\left(g \left(x \right)\right) g'\left(x\right) x'$} 
\end{itemize}
