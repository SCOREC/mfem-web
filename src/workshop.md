### Simulation and Visualization Contest

We will be holding a simulation and visualization contest open to all attendees.
Participants can submit visualizations (images or videos) from MFEM-related
simulations. The winner of the competition (selected by the organizing
committee) will receive an MFEM T-shirt. We will also feature the images in the [gallery](gallery.md).

To submit an entry in the contest,
please fill out the [Google
form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeZBs2jwmWvdgZ9WED3nIlt0pCSqm-9lURbCtSFVQN5-9gGEA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

Alternatively, you may email your submission to
[mfem@llnl.gov](mailto:mfem@llnl.gov), including your name, institution, a short
description of the simulation (the underlying physics, discretization,
application details, etc.), and visualization software used (GLVis, ParaView,
VisIt, etc.).
